ran into bug with outputting the result of the query
the page needs to reload to display the result, because to send the request
you transfer control to the flaskFile.py and it will process the request. Then
it renders the template again with the given output.
There may be a way to send the request with AJAX, I just don't know it

Changed the state abreviations in the index.html. They all used to be for alabama
plus spelling errors in the names of some states.

Not sure how to divide all the different kinds of queries into their own route so that
they can be handled separately. Only one form is mapped to one route. quickest way I can
think of is to have a bunch of if statements checking for the kind of request, and then
handling them inside of it. 

Made 2 if statements to handle 2 queries inside of runQuery route. Pretty sure we're 
not going to be using it in the final version. So I didn't write any for the rest of them
Just did it as a prototype.

cleaned up the table of all the state checkboxes. They were scattered and not uniform.
now they are in rows of 5.

noticed a bug where the table in the site hugs the left side of the page. Tried to fix
with CSS, but I suck at CSS so I couldn't fix it.
